### ENGR 421

  This is an **introductory course to machine learning.**
  
  Topics covered are **regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods; supervised and unsupervised models; linear and nonlinear models; parametric and nonparametric models; combinations of multiple models; comparisons of multiple models and model selection.**
  
  Course focuses on both mathematical background and real life applications of the algorithms. 
  
  Solutions to biweekly homeworks can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/iremddemir/engr421_introduction_to_machine_learning).  

### COMP 301

  This is a **programming languages and concepts course based on EOPL book.** 

  Topics covered are rogramming languages, concepts and paradigms. **Syntax, semantics, Abstraction, binding, run-time storage. 
  
  Course focuses on **core programming concepts, data representation, procedural representation, grammars, environment models, parsing, parameter passing, evaluation. 
  
  Also, it is the first course I took that has a functional programming approach.
  
  Solutions to three course projects in one of which we implemented a interpreter can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/iremddemir/comp301_programming_language_concepts).
  
### COMP 302
  This is an **software engineering class.** 
  
  Course focuses on **methods and tools used in software development, agile programming, object oriented design, and open software architectures.
  
  We, group of 5, implemented a **game project** of 2 week long iterations. During our implementation we followed  the project lifecycle: **requirements analysis, design, modeling, implementation, and testing.**
Related documents and the code for our impelentation can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/iremddemir/comp302_software_engineering).
